## R
I wrote my first ever line of code in R. That fateful day was January 27th, 2020. Since then I've fallen in love with the language and decided to see how far I could take it! R is essentially my means of making a living and for that I am grateful. I'm a dplyr guy at heart, but data.table has been the primary tool my co-workers use. That necessarily makes data.table my primary tool in professional settings. Personally, I find data.table unintuitive and hard to fit on one line; data.table sacrifices intuition and readability for speed. You see, R was never meant to be 'fast'--it is supposed to simplify data analysis. In this way, dplyr complements R's strengths as a language quite well. If you want to know what I *really* think, data.table compensates R's slower run time speed but stifles the features of the language that make it stand out from competitors (Python, primarily). In some final sense, if you have to rely on data.table for your everyday work, you are using the wrong tool for the job--Julia seems better suited for these tasks. I do appreciate data.table's backward compatibility, however.

### R Directories

#### cleaning/
Showcases my approach to cleaning data.

#### metaprogramming/
Showcases some key skills pertaining to metaprogramming (aka tidy evaluation) and its application in data analysis.

#### reactive_programming/
Everyone loves a good Shiny app.

#### regex/
stringr reigns supreme in R's regular expression scene. Base R's string manipulation functions are tedious due to their inconsistencies.

#### viz/
R's data visualization capabilities are second to none. Among my friends who only know R peripherally, ggplot2 is always the thing they mention.


## BASH
I was, unfortunately, born a Windows user. I used XP as a kid and never really knew other operating systems existed--except for those rich people with Apple laptops. Git for Windows and WSL2 changed everything. I use basic scripting in my day-to-day work and find it very handy for navigating through files. Nano is my editor of choice--I have no qualms with vim, but any time we spend learning one tool is time that could have been used learning another! I mostly edit in Bash for quick-and-dirty tasks and open up an IDE if the situation calls for more substantial work.
